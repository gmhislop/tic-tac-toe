# TIC TAC TOE


### GAME DESCRIPTION:
Tic Tac Toe is a paper-and-pencil game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. It is a solved game, with a forced draw assuming best play from both players. 

Because of the simplicity of tic-tac-toe, it is often used as a pedagogical tool for teaching the concepts of good sportsmanship and the branch of artificial intelligence that deals with the searching of game trees.

### GAME RULES:
A player can choose between two symbols with his opponent, usual game uses “X” and “O”.

The player that gets to play first will get the "X" mark (we call him/her player 1) and the player that gets to play second will get the "O" mark (we call him/her player 2).

Player 1 and 2 take turns making moves with Player 1 playing mark “X” and Player 2 playing mark “O”.

A player marks any of the 3x3 squares with his mark (“X” or “O”) and their aim is to create a straight line horizontally, vertically or diagonally with two intensions:
- a. One of the players gets three of his/her marks in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) i.e. that player wins the game.
- b. If no one can create a straight line with their own mark and all the positions on the board are occupied, then the game ends in a draw/tie.
